**Technical Report on Sonar Analysis: Mines vs. Rocks Classification**

### 1. Introduction

The objective of this project is to classify sonar returns to distinguish between rocks and metallic mines using machine learning. The dataset consists of 208 samples, each containing 60 frequency band energy readings ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The target label indicates whether the object is a rock (`R`) or a mine (`M`). Various classification models were evaluated to find the most effective solution for this binary classification task.

### 2. Dataset Summary

The dataset contains a balanced class distribution:
- **Mines (M)**: 111 samples
- **Rocks (R)**: 97 samples

#### Descriptive Statistics of Features
Summary statistics for the 60 frequency band features show variability in energy levels:
- **Mean** values range from 0.029 (Feature 0) to 0.208 (Feature 9), indicating average energy levels.
- **Standard Deviations** range from 0.005 to 0.13 across features, reflecting variability in the sonar frequency bands.
- **Minimum and Maximum Values** vary per feature, showcasing the diversity in energy levels across sonar returns.

### 3. Model Evaluation

Several machine learning models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, initially yielding the following results:

| Model                    | Mean Accuracy | Standard Deviation |
|--------------------------|---------------|---------------------|
| AdaBoost (AB)            | 0.7827       | 0.0724             |
| Gradient Boosting (GBM)  | 0.7897       | 0.1304             |
| Random Forest (RF)       | 0.8261       | 0.0723             |
| Extra Trees (ET)         | 0.8441       | 0.0599             |

### 4. Model Optimization and Final Model Selection

Following initial evaluation, the Extra Trees (ET) model was selected for further optimization due to its high performance and stability. Using GridSearch for hyperparameter tuning and feature scaling with StandardScaler, the ET model's accuracy significantly improved:

- **Best Tuned ET Model Accuracy**: **0.9029**

This optimized model was finalized by training on the entire training dataset and validated with a hold-out test set, confirming the model's robustness.

### 5. Conclusion

The project successfully achieved a robust classification model for sonar returns, with the optimized Extra Trees model reaching an impressive accuracy of 90.3%. This model is both accurate and stable, making it highly effective for distinguishing between rocks and mines in sonar data.

### 6. Recommendations

To enhance model performance further, consider:
- Experimenting with feature reduction techniques like PCA to remove redundant features.
- Testing additional ensemble models or deep learning techniques for potentially higher accuracy if computational resources allow.
